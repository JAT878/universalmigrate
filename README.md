# UniversalMigrate

A flexible platform for cross-database schema and data migration with a focus on security and ease of use.

## Overview

UniversalMigrate is a cloud-based platform that facilitates data migration between different database systems, including:

- SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)
- CRM platforms (Salesforce)
- Cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery)

The platform is designed with a "lift and shift" approach in mind, allowing consultants and data engineers to quickly set up, execute, and verify migrations without long-term infrastructure commitment.

## Key Features

- **Universal Connector Framework**: Extensible system for connecting to various data sources
- **Visual Schema Mapping**: Intuitive interface for mapping fields between different systems
- **Secure Execution Environment**: Isolated instances with dedicated egress points
- **Template Library**: Pre-configured patterns for common migration scenarios
- **Project-Based Deployments**: Time-limited environments with automatic cleanup
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Full logging of all data access and transformations

## Architecture

UniversalMigrate follows a multi-layered architecture:

- **Control Plane**: Manages user access, project configuration, and templates
- **Execution Plane**: Runs isolated migration instances for each customer
- **Connector Registry**: Provides standardized access to different data systems
- **Security Layer**: Handles credential management, encryption, and IP controls
